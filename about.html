        <h1 class="centered">About</h1>
        <div class="centered">This site is created and maintained by Mips96. That's me!</div>
        <br>
        <div>As a hobbyist, I've worked on a wide variety of software development projects including homebrew video games, mods,
        Python utilities, ROM organizers, and now a website. The genre and scope of my work are best described as "whatever I
        feel like working on right now", hence the variety.</div>
        <br>
        <div>Much of my work relates in some way to old video games, a subject I've always been passionate about. As gaming
        continues to evolve, the influence of games from decades ago is still felt strongly today through online communities,
        official collections, and the simple yet powerful act of inspiring new games. And with emulation technology becoming
        more advanced and user-friendly - and thanks to the dedicated efforts of preservationists - these games are currently
        more accessible than ever despite their original, aging hardware. Timeless classics, hidden gems, and
        so-bad-they're-good shovelware all have their place in a medium that's managed to thrive for over 40 years.</div>
        <br>
        <div>ROM hacks in particular have always interested me; the idea that an independent creator can transform an existing
        game into something new resonates with me. But these hacks complement the original games and are rarely intended to
        outright replace them. That's why I wanted to shine a spotlight on the relatively few hacks that do try to replace the
        original games by providing a better version of what already exists. They can offer an excuse to revisit an old classic
        or even give games that were once overlooked a second chance.</div>
        <br>
        <div>This isn't about erasing the mistakes of past developers; it's about a handful of passionate fans using their talents to
        help something they love excel to even greater heights. It's about making these games as good as they can possibly be
        and pushing them past their limits that were once caused by time constraints, a lack of budget, or technological
        advancements that hadn't been created yet. And no matter what changes people make, the original versions of these games
        will always exist for people to play as they were originally made.</div>
        <br>
