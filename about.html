        <h1>About</h1>
        <div>RH Improvements is a site that provides information about improvement hacks.</div>
        <h2>What is an improvement hack?</h2>
        <div>An improvement hack is a ROM hack that aims to improve an area of a game that is otherwise lacking. As opposed to a
        standard ROM hack which drastically changes a game's contents, an improvement hack is more like an extension of an
        existing game.</div>
        <br>
        <div>These changes can be as basic as <a href="https://mother4ever.net/earthbound-easy-patch/" target="_blank">Earthbound
        Zero's Easy Patch</a> from 2008 which increases the EXP and money earned from enemies, or as detailed as <a
        href="https://ttjontt.wixsite.com/gamehut/sonic-3d-blast-dx" target="_blank">Sonic 3D Blast Director's Cut</a>, a
        ROM hack by the original game's director which improves nearly every aspect of the game and adds optional new features,
        all while keeping the option to switch back to the original game via the main menu.</div>
        <h2>What counts as an improvement hack?</h2>
        <div>This is an abstract and subjective term, but for the purposes of this site, an improvement hack should be able to serve
        as a replacement for the original game. The changes in such a hack include, but are not limited to:</div>
            <li>Fixing detrimental bugs</li>
            <li>Restoring unused content in a way that does not significantly interfere with the rest of the game</li>
            <li>Making content that was only accessible through unconventional means obtainable through normal gameplay</li>
                <ul><li>Examples: Multiplayer only, version exclusive, or event/online exclusive content</li></ul>
            <li>Adding additional control methods or accessibility features</li>
                <ul><li>Example: Adding button controls to a DS game that originally required touch controls</li></ul>
            <li>Altering game balance/stats to make a game easier or harder</li>
            <li>Adding technical improvements</li>
                <ul><li>Examples: Utilizing SNES enhancement chips to reduce lag, or colorizing Game Boy games that were originally black/white
            only</li></ul>
        <h2>What does not count as an improvement hack?</h2>
        <div>For the purposes of this site, anything that could not serve as a replacement for the original game does not count as an
        improvement hack. This includes, but is not limited to:</div>
            <li>Removing content from the original game, even if it is replaced with new content; this includes most typical rom hacks
            such as level hacks</li>
            <li>Adding new content in a way that significantly interferes with the original game</li>
        <br>
        <div>This is also abstract, as improvements will often require altering the original game in some capacity. For example,
        modifying a Pokemon game to make the entire Pokedex catchable will generally require editing encounter rates to make the
        normally-accessible Pokemon less common. Depending on personal preferences, what some people see as an improvement may
        be considered a downgrade to others, so use your own discretion to determine whether a change is so drastic that it
        removes the identity of the original game.</div>
        <br>
        <div>Additionally, I would prefer to focus on showcasing hacks that make substantial improvements. While all improvement
        hacks are appreciated, I want the main page of this site to be concise; I don't want to flood it with patches that only
        make one or two miniscule changes. Again, please use your own discretion to determine if a hack provides a substantial
        upgrade.</div>
        <h2>Where are the Pokemon hacks?</h2>
        <div>Frankly, even when you ignore the many, <em>many</em> traditional rom hacks of mainline Pokemon games, there's such a
        large number of improvement hacks within this series that I don't know how to properly represent them aside from
        including the straightforward Red/Blue Color Hack. There are multiple hacks that implement slightly different variations
        of the same balance changes/modernizations/bug fixes, multiple hacks that add a female playable character to RBY, and
        multiple hacks that make the entire Pokedex catchable, each with their own interpretation of which Pokemon should be
        found where.</div>
        <br>
        <div>This site aims to provide a quick and easy way to find the "definitive" way to play many classic games, but the
        abundance of Pokemon hacks, each with their own subjective strengths and weaknesses, makes that difficult. You're on
        your own for this series; go dig through Romhacking.net and see what you like best.</div>

        Randomizers</a>, which has served as the primary inspiration for making this site. I tried not to make the design
        too similar!</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SNESdrunk" target="_blank">SNESdrunk</a>, whose videos about SNES improvement patches
        probably subconsciously made me want a more convenient way to find them. Also, his <em>Relaxing Super Nintendo Music</em>
        compilations have gotten me through more than a few coding sessions.</li>
